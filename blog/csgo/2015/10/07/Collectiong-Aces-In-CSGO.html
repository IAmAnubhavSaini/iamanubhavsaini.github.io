    <p>I usually spend one hour daily playing Counter Strike : Global Offensive. It’s a good game. But I do not have a very high speed internet, or a reliable one. So I play offline.</p>

<p>Now before you judge me, this is what my <code>botprofile.db</code> file looks like.</p>

<pre><code>Default

<p>I know that there are some discrepancies, but I am working on them. Anyway, after that, it’s really awesome to play with expert bots. Due to reduced aggression, they actually wait instead of just mindlessly going forward.</p>

<p>Here are a few shots of aces.</p>

<p><img src="/images/csgo/aces/1.jpg" alt="Ace 1" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/csgo/aces/2.jpg" alt="Ace 2" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/csgo/aces/3.jpg" alt="Ace 3" /><br />
I like sniping. Though to be fair, sniping bots is relatively easy. They are mindless drones.</p>

<p><img src="/images/csgo/aces/4.jpg" alt="Ace 4" /><br />
One of my favorite weapons these days: Deagle. But only offline.</p>

<p><img src="/images/csgo/aces/5.jpg" alt="Ace 5" /><br />
Yup! I have a death rattle.</p>

<p><img src="/images/csgo/aces/6.jpg" alt="Ace 6" /><br />
When I am online, USP-S is my weapon of choice.</p>

<p><img src="/images/csgo/aces/7.jpg" alt="Ace 7" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/csgo/aces/8.jpg" alt="Ace 8" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/csgo/aces/9.jpg" alt="Ace 9" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/csgo/aces/10.jpg" alt="Ace 10" /><br />
Okay, this one was awesome. It was achieved using smoke, flashes and deagle. Believe me, best way to kill unsuspecting bots is making them pass through smoke.</p>

<p><img src="/images/csgo/aces/11.jpg" alt="Ace 11" /></p>

<p>If you notice, most of the aces are using hand guns only. I am working on better aim and slow fire rate; with deagle and usp-s, I try not to fire twice. Just hide somewhere, aim and headshots. Next I will try to put some headshots on, but cannot guarantee. There are a lot of funny moments that I want to share. These are mostly bots dying and their bodies lying unexpectedly. Till then, bye bye.</p>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I’m dying, so is everybody else. People die. Organic matter decays. There’s science behind it. But I might be dying faster. That warrants some worries.</p>

<p>Hi I am Anubhav Saini - a human being who was given name Anubhav by his parents; Saini being the name of the clan.</p>

<p>It was a name given to an object that had consciousness. I was even when born felt my surroundings, thus the name given. People give name to consciousness. They do not go on to name rocks. That’s just stupid.</p>

<p>Yes yes, people have given names to Planets, Rivers and Mountains and ships and what not. But that’s because of Anthropomorphicisation of these objects.</p>

<p>People feel familiarity if name is given; associate things with it; associate feelings with it. That’s why no one names their kid ‘Pran’ or ‘Ravan’ any more. But there are about 10 million Ram running around.</p>

<p>Anyway my reproducers gave me an identity for the world to differentiate me from others. Well, that has worked one sided and wonderfully. I on the other hand have failed to utilize this single opportunity and differentiate myself from world myself. I have failed in that contest.</p>

<p>But why?</p>

<p>Was I stupid? Am I stupid? People will answer yes and no depending upon who you ask. I’d say, I am not stupid. I just do not have control over my mind.</p>

<p>Hmm, I do not have control over mind. Who does? Think about mind as a parasite that forced humanoids to have bigger upward pump than available so that it can work better. Mind sucks so much nutrients and energy that if provided it can generate enough wealth for you so that you can feed it with more nutrients and energy.</p>

<p>It’s a perfect symbiotic relationship. Mine is just screwed up. I do not want more energy, more nutrients and more money. I just want peace. But that’s not going to happen.</p>

<p>See, I have fungal sinusitis - my doctors told me 5 years ago that. Then they operated on me. I stayed 2 and half years good and then one day my room mate lit a cigarrette and I started dying again. It clogged my sinuses very fast. I am not sure If I can sue him. I could if I was in US or UK, but in India it will take aweful lot of years to wind up.</p>

<p>Then I got a job and cold, AC made me shiver. I had to quit from that job. Then I had to take another job. I was feeling good again. My life was not a ridiculous waste of time anymore. I had purpose to get up in the moring and take a bath. I have always had a purpose to get up and work, it’s bath that I had no reason before to take. Anyway, I learned that when under pressure, if I sleep on my left side, my eye, left one, will fill up with blood. I went to doctors, in a big hospital near diamond district. They wouldn’t listen to me. I told them that I was dying. They wouldn’t listen. I told them that blood in eye + vomiting makes a good reason to be tested. They wouldn’t listen. I wanted them to test me, not treat me for what I thought what was wrong with me; just test me and figure out from there. Anyway, they didn’t perform any tests on me. I was fired from that job for under-performing after a while.</p>

<p>I think I should sue that hospital, but then, years it would take…</p>

<p>I got to realize that my problems are here to stay forever and I will be an under performer forever. I can live with that. But then, I was stung by an insect, it was not a bee or other familiar stinging insect, it was green and was crushed into a plop rather than it’s exosceleton being crushed. What happens when you get bit by an insect and run to a doctor? You get sleep-inducing but anti-allergy medicine. You take it. It hurts a lot. So you take more of these.</p>

<p>What happens when you take a lot of such medicine and while cleaning your nose with Jal-Neti?</p>

<p>Yes, huge chunks of collected, dried out nasal mucousa (sounds like furiosa’s brother) comes out. I mean huge. I mean multiple chunks.</p>

<p>But after a few days of spraying small chunks in nose-blow, it stopped. My sinusitis was gone. I could blow my nose clear and breathe properly.</p>

<p>All was well, until yesterday. My nose clogged at once. Couldn’t breathe anymore from nose. My head started hurting. I took one dose that was lying around. After 4 hours another huge chunk came out of it.</p>

<p>It should have been relief but what happens when you take anti-allergy medicine that has drowsyness as one of it’s side effects?</p>

<p>Well, you sleep. A lot.</p>

<p>I wanted to wake up and do stuff. I do not work, because I cannot but boy do I keep myself busy!</p>

<p>I do.</p>

<p>Various coursera courses keep me busy.</p>

<p>My mind told me that I cannot continue working and have to sleep. I am a consciousness that has it’s own identity. I am not my mind but a chosen subset of it. My mind knows that there are infinite roles I can take. I can be a murderer, a suicider, or a suicide bomber - the last one combines the first two. My mind knows that I can become a doctor or a surgeon or an engineer - actually I am. My mind knows that it can handle complex tasks as writing and book keeping pretty well. But, I on the other hand am a subset of my mind. I do not confirm what my mind knows. My mind can know anything, but I as a conscience inside my mind, have to refrain from becoming anything.</p>

<p>I am Anubhav Saini. I am dying. So, are you. I want to tell world what I am and not what it sees as what I am. I am better than what I have let world see. But I have physical boundaries. So, does everyone else. Mine are shrinking pretty fast. I am sitting and watching as my degenerative brain degenerates; I can comprehend it. It’s not enough for people around me to recognise it. I have strong will to not let that happen. But, it’s bothering me. Keeping me from actively doing what I can do.</p>

<p>I am Anubhav Saini and I am dying; whether you care or not. I want to act as a sane person does. But is there any sanity in the world?</p>

<p>People think that they are in control. Are they?</p>

<p>Has anyone been in control? Ever? What does that feel like? Have they controlled other human beings? What does that feel like?</p>

<p>Has anyone recovered from what I am facing? A severe pain in head that feels like a cluster-headache - it runs for days and hurts like hell. What sort of life do I have? Is it what I was given? Bad genes and bad environment. Did I do this to me?</p>

<p>Are my habits bad that they stop me from doing what matters. I do not like to work for stupid people. But aren’t people sitting on top are all stupid. They are so far from reality of low level that their decisions make no sense. Am I not stupid for not working for money?</p>

<p>Am I crazy?</p>

<p>Does anyone has any clue what they are? I am a chemical bag that has a neural network sitting at top, puppeteering small puppets in the bag. It’s like a musical device: Drink coffee, a different tempo; eat butter a different tempo; eat sleep-inducing anti-allergy medicines - a different tempo. Is the spelling of tempo right?</p>

<p>What we put in our body goes to work, some times early, some times late. Chemicals have a profound affect on our bodies. I can drink H2O but not H2O2. The difference is very small in both. One is practically water, other is. One has only one Oxygen and other has two of them. More is not better in this case. Less is more.</p>

<p>I want to scream that I do not like to put chemicals in my body. My DNA, flawed wants them. My flawed genes require outside help. I cannot continue with stupid morbid gene-pool.</p>

<p>Now I think about it, I am the first child of my parents. My parents that comprise a female and a male, otherwise lovingly called mother and father. My mother’s side have this bad genetic disorder that affects brain. I think it skips some, but it is there. For example, one of the brothers of my mother’s father was a lunatic. He had degenerated brain disease. My mother’s brother’s son has is a bad egg too. He has a degenerated brain. Impaired learning and bad cognitive skills. I do not have have learning disability but I cannot know that for sure. I am me. Someone who knows more about learning has to tell. I can tell you that new information hurts my head. That’s why I do not like surprises well. That’s why learning new stuff makes my head hurt and I sort of refrain from it. That’s why I am a slow implementer. That’s why…</p>

<p>Wait a minute, I and my cousin are both the first child. I do not know if the degenerate grand-father (brother of grandfather), was first child or not. I am leaving space for this information for updation purposes. (Space that will be updated if he was first child or not)</p>

<p>Can there be a disease that affects only the first kid?</p>

<p>With skipping and gene variation, it might have small affect on me. Undetectably small perhaps. Small enough to write-up as personality (or personality disorder) by anyone who comes in my contact. But what if it is really a genetic disorder?</p>

<p>Well, that’s life.</p>

<p>I am Anubhav Saini. I am dying. I hope to write more about it before I kick the bucket though.</p>

<p>For now, bye bye. Come back for more real-life-tragedy-description, later.</p>

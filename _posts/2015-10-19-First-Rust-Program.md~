We are going to say hello, world! in rust too. In C this is very simple and throughly known.  

C
=

	#include <stdio.h>  
	
	void main() {  
		printf("Hello, World!");  
	}  


Rust
=

	fn main() {  
		println!("Hello, World!");  
	}  



How to build binary?
=

- Save file as `file_name.rs`
- run `rustc file_name.rs`
- run `file_name.exe` or `./file_name`


Example build
=

Well that's odd. It's exactly the same. I mean look-wise. Let's find the similarities first and then differences.  

Similarities
=

- Both take a string inside double quotes.  
- Both have main() as their starting function.  
- Both use parenthesis { and } for block delineation.


Differences
=

- `fn` marks a function in rust.  
- If returning nothing, we do not need to specify it in rust.  
- In rust, we do not need to include a file for something as trivial as printing to screen.  
- In rust, println is a macro whereas in c it is a function.

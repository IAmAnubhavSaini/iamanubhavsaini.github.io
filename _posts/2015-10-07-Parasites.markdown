I like parasites. I didn't once. But then I saw this [video on TED](http://go.ted.com/bNjV) and boy do I like parasites now.

Wikipedia says  

>In biology/ecology, parasitism is a non-mutual symbiotic relationship between species, where one species, the parasite, benefits at the expense of the other, the host.  
<p>
Let's break it down.  
</p><p>
Parasites indulge in non-mutually-helpful relationship. Parasitism is not marriage or any other partnership. One being, which is looking for resources latches onto another being, which is full of resources.   
</p><p>
Parasitism is inter-specieal. I'm not sure that it's a word, but it's ought to. A resources seeking being doesn't go to another resourceful being of same species. So, calling a human being parasite, if he/she sucked someone else's resources dry, a parasite would be wrong. Technically.   
</p><p>
Parasite benefits at the expense of the other; which means the relationship might not be permanent. For example, as soon as a human being comes to know about a potential parasite within it's body, one launches full on chemical attack on said parasite.  
</p><p>
There are two types of parasites. MicroParasites: ones that we cannot see using just the naked eyes. MacroParasites: ones that we can.  
</p>

Based on whether parasites kill their host delibrately divides them into two categories: parasites that don't and parasitoids that do.  

According to wikipedia:  

>A parasitoid is an organism that spends a significant portion of its life history attached to or within a single host organism in a relationship that is in essence parasitic; unlike a true parasite, however, it ultimately sterilises or kills, and sometimes consumes, the host.

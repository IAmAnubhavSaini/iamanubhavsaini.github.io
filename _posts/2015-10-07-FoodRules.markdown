I like [XKCD](http://xkcd.com/).

This post is about food rules that xkcd posted recently. I had a very bad experience yesterday at Dominos and thus came up with my own rule yesterday; conincidently I saw this comic on xkcd today. So I am going to show you my food rules, but first here's the xkcd comic.

Anyway, here's mine:

That's it.

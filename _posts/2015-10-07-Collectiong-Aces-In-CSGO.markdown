I usually spend one hour daily playing Counter Strike : Global Offensive. It's a good game. But I do not have a very high speed internet, or a reliable one. So I play offline.  

Now before you judge me, this is what my `botprofile.db` file looks like.

    Default
        Skill = 100
        Aggression = 50
        ReactionTime = 0.01
        Teamwork = 100
        AttackDelay = 0
        AimFocusInitial = 0.001			// initial focus spread in degrees (from desired center)
        AimFocusDecay = 0.9				// how much focus shrinks per second (.25 = 25% of size after 1 sec)
        AimFocusOffsetScale = 0		// controls accuracy when tracking to target (0 == perfect, should always be < 1)
        AimfocusInterval = 0			// how often focus is adjusted (smaller intervals means better movement tracking)
        WeaponPreference = none
        Difficulty = NORMAL
        VoicePitch = 70
        Skin = 0
        LookAngleMaxAccelNormal = 2000.0
        LookAngleStiffnessNormal = 100.0
        LookAngleDampingNormal = 25.0
        LookAngleMaxAccelAttacking = 3000.0
        LookAngleStiffnessAttacking = 150.0
        LookAngleDampingAttacking = 30.0
    End

    ...
    
    Template Gunners
        WeaponPreference = m4a1
        WeaponPreference = ak47
        WeaponPreference = aug
        WeaponPreference = sg556
        WeaponPreference = awp
        WeaponPreference = p90
    End
    
    ...
    
    Template GIJOE
        Skill = 100
        Rank = 1800
        Aggression = 50
        ReactionTime = 0.01
        Difficulty = EXPERT
        VoicePitch = 75
        AimFocusInitial = 0.1
        AimFocusDecay = 0.01
        AimFocusOffsetScale = 0.01
        AimfocusInterval = 0.01
        Teamwork = 100
    End
    
    ...
    
    
I know that there are some discrepancies, but I am working on them. Anyway, after that, it's really awesome to play with expert bots. Due to reduced aggression, they actually wait instead of just mindlessly going forward.

Here are a few shots of aces.

I like sniping. Though to be fair, sniping bots is relatively easy. They are mindless drones.  

![Ace 4](/images/csgo/aces/4.jpg)  
One of my favorite weapons these days: Deagle. But only offline.  


![Ace 5](/images/csgo/aces/5.jpg)  
Yup! I have a death rattle. 


![Ace 6](/images/csgo/aces/6.jpg)  
When I am online, USP-S is my weapon of choice.  


![Ace 7](/images/csgo/aces/7.jpg)  

![Ace 8](/images/csgo/aces/8.jpg)  

![Ace 9](/images/csgo/aces/9.jpg)  

![Ace 10](/images/csgo/aces/10.jpg)  
Okay, this one was awesome. It was achieved using smoke, flashes and deagle. Believe me, best way to kill unsuspecting bots is making them pass through smoke.

If you notice, most of the aces are using hand guns only. I am working on better aim and slow fire rate; with deagle and usp-s, I try not to fire twice. Just hide somewhere, aim and headshots. Next I will try to put some headshots on, but cannot guarantee. There are a lot of funny moments that I want to share. These are mostly bots dying and their bodies lying unexpectedly. Till then, bye bye.

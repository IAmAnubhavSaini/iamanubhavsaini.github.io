            <h1>A Poorly Written Book</h1>
            <div class="summary">
                <span>Summary</span>: I bought a book on Data Structures; "Data Structures And Algorithms Made Easy" by Narasimha Karumanchi.
                <br/>
                <br/> A book that makes it's reader feel inadequate at articulating how bad it is. In a nutshell: it is poorly written, inadequately editored and haphazardly put together.
                <br/>
                <br />But this is a blessing in disguise. I am writing my own book, here, online.
            </div>
            <p>
                I was looking for ways to make my understanding of basic data structures better. So, I tried asking friends. A lot of my friends were swearing by this book. This book turned out to be "Data Structures and Algorithms Made Easy" by an IITian, no less, an M.Tech. So, I bought it. A lot of reviews said that the the book was good.
                <br /> There are a lot of problems with the book; from grammar mistakes to English-language-level mistakes, from bad questions to not-required-stupid questions. I wouldn't be complaining; but it's second edition; so not acceptable.
                </br />
                <br /> There are many mistakes. I read 60 pages; found 120 mistakes. I stopped reading it at that point. I can tell what the mistakes are, but that is just writing the whole damn book again.
            </p>
            <p>Thus begins the book on DS that anyone can read like a novel and be done with it sooner; and with better understanding of programming and data structures.</p>
            <p>
                I would like to make it clear that my book, the Galaxy's guide to programming, is not result of this horror I just mentioned. I have been writing articles for 3+ years now. And now, it is just the time when I have decided to put those articles in better form and as a book.

                <span>Summary</span>: 4 New, just out of college grads joined us and We had to begin their training.
            </div>
            <p>So we hired April, Dominik, Ekta, and Kevin.
                <br />
                <br />I know what you are thinking: if we take first letters of their names, we'd have all the fat-soluble vitamins. We know because that's what she said. No, that's what Nitya said; literally. Nitya is a chem freak; who somehow ended up with us-coding-freaks. She's brilliant coder and loves talking on and on about anything that fascinates her.
                <br />
                <br /> Any Monday, you can tell what she read last week-end. We have stopped asking her what she did last week-end.
                <br />
                <br /> Anyway, new hires go to Nitya for a character building. Just kidding. She gives them coding tasks and teaches them for 3 months. We do this once a year. Nitya loves it, we love it.
            </p>
            <p>Hi guys, I am Nitya. You guys are stuck with me for 3 months. We are going to learn and have fun. Actually, I am going to have fun, you are going to learn. You can have fun too. There's a simple recipe for it: <span class="recipe">Read other's code after you have finished writing yours.</span>
                <br />
                <br /> I want you guys to start with a simple program. You have to find maximum out of two numbers. That's your requirement. It has been given to you. Get to code.
            </p>
            <p>After a few minutes, this is the code they came up with.
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                <h5>April's code</h5>
                <p>
                    int FindMax (int A, int B)
                    { 
                        return A &gt; B ? A : B;

                            return B; 

                        return max;

                    void Max(){ 
                        int A, B, max; 

                        printf("\nEnter two numbers: \n");
                        scanf("%d %d",&amp;A, &amp;B);

                        else
                            max = B;

                        printf("\nMax of %d and %d is %d.", A, B, max);
                    }
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="code">
                <h5>Kevin's code</h5>
                <p>
                    int MaxOf2Numbers(int A, int B)
                    {
                        int max = INT_MIN;

                        if(max &lt; A)
                            max = A;
                        
                        if(max &lt; B)
                            max = B;
                        
                        return max;
                    }
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                Now, if it was Chloe who was training them she'd be using all the manual tools. But, since we wrote our own code AI, named it Aia. We don't need to do manual labor. Nitya does exactly that.
                <br /><br />
                Nitya, speaks up, towards roof, "Aia, sort their code files by LOC and run basic diagnostics for later."
                A blue light fluctuates as Nitya speaks as a 3 inch wide strip on walls is apparently alive.
                <br />
                <br />
                So let's see. Hmm, April first. Which one of you is April? 
                <br />
                <br />
                April stands up. She is thin and tall. If she was Arts major, she would be travelling France with her love-of-the-season. Or if she was Chemistry major, she'd be helping me getting those bottles down from top most shelf. OR whatever. Back to work Nitya.
                <br />
                <br />
                Explain your code, I asked. Though there is nothing to explain, it's good to let new people speak more often. They feel confident faster, plus I like to hear humans. Is it that bad. I am not Conway, but it sure gives me a peep into their character.
                <br />
                <br />
                April clears up her throat briefly. Opens her arms sideways and brings together to say, "This piece of code just takes two integers, compares them using conditional operator and returns the bigger of two."
                <br /><br />
                Good enough, I thought. That's exactly what code does. "I do have a question though". "Would you be okay if I ask you a question?" - It's better than a suggestion. Who says no to a question?
                <br /><br />
                Yes go ahead - said April. Wouldn't it be nice if you created a variable named max and saved the intermediate result in it and returned max. It might have been better for debugging?
                <br /><br />
                Okay a bad question. But let's see what April comes up with. April thinks for a moment, "I actually thought that, but then figured that code is one liner and no brainer. Initializing a variable seemed, overkill. I hope that makes sense."
                <br /><br />
                Hmm, beauty and brains - I thouhght. "Good thinking. But remember, don't over do it." April shakes her head positive with smile.
                <br /><br />
                Moving on to Ekta. Ekta is from India. She did her Bachelor's degree here, like I did. I pull her code up on the screen.
